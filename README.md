# IODS-final
My final assignment on the IODS-course, 2017.
My name is Emma Haapa and I am a beginner at data science. I have been studying statistic, but this new approach is new and interesting to me, as I've previously only worked with the theoretical aspect of the statistics in question. I hope that through this course my skills in data science have improved and it can be seen in this final assignment.
